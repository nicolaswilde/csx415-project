## Model Evaluation

### Part1 Salary Estimation

At first, let us see the result.

```{r}
source('..\\tests\\SalaryPredTest_rpart.R')
```

Then, let us see the real salaries.

```{r}
salary <- read.csv("..\\data\\PlayerSalary.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
salary_1718 <- salary[, c("Player", "X1718")]
print(salary_1718)
```

In the result of tree model, generally speaking, good players earn high salaries and bad players earn low salaries. However, the prediction is not precise. Because of the limitation of classification, too many players earn the same, which is not the common situation.

As for the nodes, we can see the root node is to judge if MP < 30.05. It makes sense because 30 minutes is approximately the bound of stars and normal players. The next node is to judge if game number as starter < 49.5. It also makes sense because player that played 50 games as starter must be a qualified player. However, the next several nodes are all about age. I don't think 23 years old and 24 years old make a big difference.

### Part2 Game Result Estimation

At first, let us see the result. Positive game_pred means lose the game while negative game_pred means win the game.

```{r}
source('..\\tests\\GamePredTest_rpart.R')
```

Then, let us see the real game result.
```{r}
team_list <- read.csv("..\\data\\TeamList.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
game_data = data.frame()
for (i in 1:30) {
    team_id <- team_list[,1][i]
    team_log <- read.csv(paste("..\\data\\TeamGameLog1718\\", team_id, ".csv", sep=""), stringsAsFactors=F)
    team_col = rep(team_id, 82)
    team_log <- data.frame(Team=team_col, team_log)
    game_data <- rbind(game_data, team_log)
}
print(game_data)
```

In the result of linear model, generally speaking, top teams usually defeat weak teams. But the prediction is more like the result of a series. The error of a single game, which holds about 40% is inevitable because the results of several games between the same teams are usually different.

As for the nodes, some nodes make sense. The root node means that if your hit rate < 44.8%, you must lose the game. Definitely FG% is one of the most significant factor deciding a game. One of the path means when you cannot limit your opponent's 2pts shoot under 50.45% and meanwhile you cannot score more than 109.2, you will lose the game. Though it is a pretty simple principle, it makes some sense.

### Part3 Team Quality Estimation

At first, let us see the result.

```{r}
source('..\\tests\\TeamQualityPredTest_rpart.R')
```

Then, let us see the real NBA standings.

From the form, the prediction result is ok and the playoff teams are still ranking in the first 16 teams. The ranking is more accurate than linear model but improvement is still needed.

### Part4 Trading & Signing Proposal

todo..

## Project Evaluation

The most valuable part of this project is the Trading & Signing Proposal part, which is not done yet.

At present, the models are able to roughly predict the results. In the next step, I will list possible trading & signing choices and calculate each team quality after operation to find an optimal operation.

Those trades and signings in 2017-18 season can be used to evaluating this project.
